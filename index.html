    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>

    <p>
      We are young children who want to change the world. We make comics to
      fight boredom, we praise to always Recycle, Reuse, and Rethink our
      choices, and more! We hope to change the world while doing things in a fun
      and creative way since we are young children at the time we made this
      website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, if you are young like us, you are a hundred percent available to
      join, though adults are still more than welcome to join us too, it's just
      not likely that would happen.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussing Processes</h2>

    <h3>Project Process</h3>

    <p>
      We have a way to make projects. Developers call it the Project Process.
      Our process is like this. We will show you a list. For now, I will
      explain it to you. When I'm done, I'll show you a list.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, we plan out what we are making. We ask common questions like:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Is this a book? Is it not?</li>
      <li>What will we call it?</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Info</h2>

    <h3>Contact</h3>

      are in Google Gmail. These might not work in Microsoft Outlook.
