    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <h2>The Team</h2>

    <h3>Dividing</h3>

    <p>
      Our company is divided into groups such as the newest one: Super Comix
      Inc. We do this to avoid arguing about what we are doing every day, by
      keeping all our work in one place so we can easily remember where and what
      we are working on and how much we like it. That is why we decided to
      divide our team.
    </p>

    <h3>Imagine</h3>

    <p>
      The reason why we debate is that we always forget how much we like the
      thing we are arguing over. We try to be as imaginative and as fun as
      possible while we work and play since we are still young kids at this
      time. If you are okay with that, then you would be fine joining our team.
