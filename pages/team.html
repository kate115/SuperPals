      <p>
        Welcome! We made this website to tell you about our business: The Super
        Pals! If you are a newcomer and are interested in us, or if you are trying
        to find a promising company, you can look at this website and learn more
        about us: The Super Pals! Here is the team page. Learn about our team,
        who are in it, how we divide it, and way more, so stick around if you want
        to know more about us. We are asking more people to join every day. But,
        there is a low chance that they will say yes, so we are stuck right now,
        but if you happen to like our company and want to join, there's no way
        we'll say no! People we want to show you are the following: <span id="member">...</span>
        I hope you spend some time meeting them! They are the most hard-working ones
        in this company, so they would be our honorable mentions!

    <h2>The Team</h2>

    <h3>Dividing</h3>

    <p>
      Our company is divided into groups such as the newest one: Super Comix
      Inc. We do this to avoid arguing about what we are doing every day, by
      keeping all our work in one place so we can easily remember where and what
      we are working on and how much we like it. That is why we decided to
      divide our team. The reason why we debate is that we always forget how much
      we like the thing we are arguing over. That is why we divide our team.
      We have a separate mind in each team, so we know how much we love it.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Divided Teams</h3>

    <p>
      We have teams, and we divide them! Here is a list of our teams. People
      that are in that team are indented. We currently have only two teams,
      but we are still fine with that.
    </p>

      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Imagine</h3>

    <p>
      We try to be as imaginative and as fun as possible while we work and play
      since we are still young kids at this time. If you are okay with that, then
      you would be fine joining our team. But, if you're not the imaginative
      person that we are, just remember, it's your choice if you want to leave or
      join.
