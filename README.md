# Welcome to The Super Pals!
## Introduction
Hi! We are the Super Pals! I'm so glad you came. This website will cover all about us. The Super Pals!
We should tell you about how this started. One day, I had a fun fair. I told my friends about it, and they
decided to help me make something for it. Long story short, our MossTree project couldn't make it. But, we
did get an idea for a company! We thought of a good name, and we got The Super Pals! Over the days, we made
lots of fun things, and I, Melody, the writer and coder of the team, is making a website about us!

## Why we made this website
We, The Super Pals, always wanted to be famous. But, being famous isn't always that easy. One day, when I
was alone, I decided that we should have a website! And then, this website was born. When I first started
this, I wasn't so sure about it. But later, it turned out great! And so, this website was also born!
